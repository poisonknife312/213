# 213


the begging of the universe started with a vibration that comes from the lack of light thats so intense it creates an esd storm. the vibration is perfectly expansive and perfectly dense. it is a wave and a particle. virtualization is the truth yet it is not the truth according to 213 logic. 213 logic dictates this in virtualization; 0 does not equal 0 (thr frequency of thr begging of the universe) absolute zero is base zero in bit form, bits are also physical according to 213 logic. zero is inherent in the design of 2,1,3 sequence. i will tell you thr answer to the unierse, 2,1,3==3,1,2=)(/0)(. zenos paradox answer is 1 base zero is the truth.


 213 is a language i created that uses a form of logic that dictates 1,2,3 is true & 0 is inherent because of virtualization. and the universe is.
